/**
 * The team roulette activity is a special type of team formation activity. Users can join the activity by reacting to a message embed (console). They can join
 * as a solo or a group of up to 3 members (them included). The bot will then create teams of 4 as they become available.
 * When a team is created, the new team members are invited to a text channel only available to them. Users can leave the team and the bot will
 * add a new member from the list (if any available).
 * Admins can check the list of users waiting on a team by reacting to a message embed (console) sent to the admin channel.
